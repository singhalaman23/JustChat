# JustChat
JustChat is a chatting web application made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and Socket.io.
Currently, the nodejs backend is deployed on Heroku and the HTML/CSS frontend is deployed on Github pages. You can access the website using the link https://singhalaman23.github.io/JustChat-frontend/

But heroku servers can sometimes run into some problems, and also the free dynos (free deploying service) provided by heroku is also going to be revoked from 28th November 2022.
So, after that, it may happen that you will only be able to see the frontend of this website, and you will not be able to chat at realtime for that moment. So you may need to run the node server at your local computer.

For running the app in your local computer, you need to run the node server for the server_side_backend files in your local computer by running the command `npm start`.
( Obviously you need to have node and npm pre-installed on your system for doing this ! )
